## Set GOPATH

A quick workaround if you need to change GOPATH to another directory (e.g. you have another project elsewhere).

1. Copy **setgopath.sh** to your project's root directory.
2. Whenever you start working with your project, open Terminal and **run**:
```
. ./setgopath.sh
```

#### **That's it!** Your GOPATH is now set to wherever you ran this script from.
